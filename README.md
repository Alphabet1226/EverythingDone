## Personal project analysis

### Attractive parts

**Beautiful design and details, and the method to implement them**

### Weak points

- Complicated code and logic somewhere, especially in `Activity` classes
- Relatively out-of-date project structure, no kotlin, no MVVM, no Rx, no Jetpack...
- Has nothing to do with network communication
- You may have some different ideas about UI or functionality design
- **Code will not be updated any longer. I'm so sorry about this.**

Please forgive me about them. I'm not a professional Android developer. I wrote this app only to meet my own demands and find some fun for myself 3 years ago when I just learned to code for 1 year. Now I even don't use an Android phone and have no time to better this app.

## Build instructions

Import in Android studio, and make project. Maybe Android Studio will require some missing files but that should be handled well by the IDE.

**Notice:** Unfortunately, as time flies, Gradle, SDK and dependencies version in this project are all out-of-data. It's hard to update them to latest ones because there may be some minor bugs with API changes after upgrade. But you can still have a try!

## More to say

- This is the first time I open-sourced a project that has been developed for quite a few time and makes me satisfied. If you have any suggestions, please tell me directly on issues page
- I really enjoy myself when developing an app like this, so EverythingDone v2 is under developing now
